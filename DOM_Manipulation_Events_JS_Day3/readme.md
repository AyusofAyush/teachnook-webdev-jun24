## Javascript Cookies
```
A cookie is an amount of information that persists between a server-side and a client-side. A web browser stores this information at the time of browsing.

A cookie contains the information as a string generally in the form of a name-value pair separated by semi-colons. It maintains the state of a user and remembers the user's information among all the web pages.


- When a user sends a request to the server, then each of that request is treated as a new request sent by the different user.
- So, to recognize the old user, we need to add the cookie with the response from the server.
- browser at the client-side.
- Now, whenever a user sends a request to the server, the cookie is added with that request automatically. Due to the cookie, the server recognizes the users.
