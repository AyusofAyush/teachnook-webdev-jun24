## Lets talk about Express.js
Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. Here’s a comprehensive guide to understanding the basics of Express.js:

### What is Express.js?

- **Express.js** is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- It facilitates the rapid development of Node-based web applications.

### Key Features

1. **Middleware**: Functions that execute during the request-response cycle.
2. **Routing**: Defining URL routes to handle requests.
3. **Templates**: Supports various template engines to dynamically render HTML.
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling for the entire application.

### Setting Up Express.js

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. **Initialize a Project**: Create a new directory and run `npm init` to initialize a Node.js project.
3. **Install Express**: Install Express.js using npm.

```bash
npm install express
```

### Basic Application

Create a file named `app.js`:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Run the application:

```bash
node app.js
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see "Hello, World!".

### Middleware

Middleware functions are executed sequentially during the request-response cycle. They can:
- Execute code
- Modify the request and response objects
- End the request-response cycle
- Call the next middleware function

Example of using middleware:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(logger);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Routing

Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint.

Example routes:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Home Page');
});

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Page');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Form Submitted');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Handling Different HTTP Methods

Express provides methods to handle different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

```javascript
app.get('/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.send('GET request');
});

app.post('/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.send('POST request');
});

app.put('/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.send('PUT request');
});

app.delete('/resource', (req, res) => {
  res.send('DELETE request');
});
```

### Serving Static Files

Express can serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Place your static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) in the `public` directory.

### Handling Form Data

To handle form data, you need to use middleware to parse the request body.

```bash
npm install body-parser
```

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  const { name, email } = req.body;
  res.send(`Received name: ${name}, email: ${email}`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Templating Engines

Express supports various templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars to render dynamic HTML.

Install Pug:

```bash
npm install pug
```

Set up Pug in your Express application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.set('view engine', 'pug');
app.set('views', './views');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.render('index', { title: 'Hey', message: 'Hello there!' });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Create a `views` directory and an `index.pug` file:

```pug
doctype html
html
  head
    title= title
  body
    h1= message
```

### Error Handling

Centralized error handling in Express can be done using middleware.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!');
});

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Summary

- **Middleware**: Functions that modify request and response objects.
- **Routing**: Define how your application responds to various HTTP requests.
- **Static Files**: Serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Templating Engines**: Render dynamic HTML using templating engines like Pug or EJS.

## What is ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
ORM (Object Relational Mapping) is a programming technique used in software development to convert data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. In the context of backend development, an ORM allows developers to interact with a database using the language constructs of their preferred programming language instead of writing raw SQL queries.

Here are some key points about ORM:

1. **Abstraction**: ORM abstracts the database interactions by mapping database tables to classes in a programming language. Each row in a table is represented as an instance of a class, and each column in the table is represented as an attribute of the class.

2. **Ease of Use**: By using an ORM, developers can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database using familiar object-oriented paradigms. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code and makes the code more readable and maintainable.

3. **Database Independence**: ORMs often provide a level of database independence, meaning the same code can work with different database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) with minimal changes.

4. **Security**: ORMs can help prevent SQL injection attacks by using parameterized queries or other mechanisms to handle user inputs safely.

5. **Schema Management**: Many ORM frameworks include tools for managing database schemas, including migrations, which help keep the database schema in sync with the application’s models.

### Examples of ORMs in Different Languages

- **Python**: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Sequelize, TypeORM
- **Java**: Hibernate, EclipseLink
- **Ruby**: ActiveRecord (used in Ruby on Rails)
- **PHP**: Doctrine, Eloquent (used in Laravel)

### Example in Python using SQLAlchemy

Here’s a simple example of how ORM might be used in Python with SQLAlchemy:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

# Define the database URL
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///example.db"

# Create the database engine
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

# Create a base class for our classes definitions
Base = declarative_base()

# Define a User class mapped to a users table
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    email = Column(String)

# Create the users table
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

# Create a session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Create a new user instance
new_user = User(name="John Doe", email="john.doe@example.com")

# Add the new user to the session and commit the transaction
session.add(new_user)
session.commit()

# Query the database
user = session.query(User).filter_by(name="John Doe").first()
print(user.email)  # Output: john.doe@example.com
```

In this example:
- We define a `User` class with attributes corresponding to the columns of the `users` table.
- We use SQLAlchemy to create the database schema.
- We create a new user and save it to the database.
- We query the database for a user with a specific name and print the email address.

ORMs are powerful tools that can simplify database interactions and improve code quality in backend development.

More Examples:

Certainly! In Node.js/Express.js, one of the popular ORM libraries is Sequelize. Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server. Below is an example of how you can use Sequelize in a Node.js/Express.js application to interact with a SQL database.

To use MySQL as the database with Sequelize ORM in a Node.js/Express.js application, you'll follow similar steps as before but ensure that the connection is specifically configured for MySQL. Here's how you can set up and use Sequelize with a MySQL database:

### Step-by-Step Example Using Sequelize with MySQL

#### 1. Install Sequelize and the MySQL driver:

```bash
npm install sequelize mysql2 express
```

#### 2. Set up Sequelize and define a model:

Create a `models` directory with an `index.js` file and a `user.js` file.

**models/index.js:**

```javascript
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');

// Create a new Sequelize instance
const sequelize = new Sequelize('database_name', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'mysql', // Specify 'mysql' as the dialect
  logging: false,   // Disable logging, you can enable it for debugging
});

// Test the connection
sequelize.authenticate()
  .then(() => console.log('Database connection established.'))
  .catch(err => console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', err));

module.exports = { sequelize };
```

**models/user.js:**

```javascript
const { DataTypes } = require('sequelize');
const { sequelize } = require('./index');

// Define the User model
const User = sequelize.define('User', {
  name: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
  },
  email: {
    type: DataTypes.STRING,
    allowNull: false,
    unique: true,
  },
}, {
  tableName: 'users', // This is optional, Sequelize will use 'Users' by default
});

module.exports = User;
```

#### 3. Sync the database and create the table:

**sync.js:**

```javascript
const { sequelize } = require('./models');
const User = require('./models/user');

// Sync all defined models to the database
sequelize.sync({ force: true })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Database synced.');
    
    // Create a sample user
    return User.create({
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john.doe@example.com'
    });
  })
  .then(user => {
    console.log('User created:', user.toJSON());
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('Error syncing database:', err);
  })
  .finally(() => {
    sequelize.close();
  });
```

Run the sync script to create the table and insert a sample user:

```bash
node sync.js
```

#### 4. Use the model in your Express application:

**app.js:**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { sequelize } = require('./models');
const User = require('./models/user');

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// Create a new user
app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.create(req.body);
    res.status(201).json(user);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Get all users
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const users = await User.findAll();
    res.json(users);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Get a user by ID
app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id);
    if (user) {
      res.json(user);
    } else {
      res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Update a user by ID
app.put('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id);
    if (user) {
      await user.update(req.body);
      res.json(user);
    } else {
      res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(400).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Delete a user by ID
app.delete('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const user = await User.findByPk(req.params.id);
    if (user) {
      await user.destroy();
      res.status(204).end();
    } else {
      res.status(404).json({ error: 'User not found' });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Start the server
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
  
  // Test the database connection
  sequelize.authenticate()
    .then(() => console.log('Database connection established.'))
    .catch(err => console.error('Unable to connect to the database:', err));
});
```

In this example:
- We configure Sequelize to connect to a MySQL database.
- We define a `User` model and sync the database schema.
- We create an Express.js application with routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users.
- We handle database interactions using the `User` model with Sequelize.

This setup provides a complete example of using Sequelize ORM with MySQL in a Node.js/Express.js application.


## TypeORM in Express.js

### Basics of TypeORM

**TypeORM** is an ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5). It supports various databases like MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL Server, and more. It allows developers to manage database schemas and interactions using TypeScript classes and decorators, making it type-safe and easy to use.

### Key Features of TypeORM

1. **Entity Management**: Defines database tables as TypeScript classes.
2. **Repositories**: Provides methods for managing entities.
3. **Migrations**: Manages changes to the database schema over time.
4. **Relationships**: Supports one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
5. **Query Builder**: Provides a flexible way to build and execute database queries.

### Creating a Basic Project with TypeORM and Express

Let's create a basic project using TypeORM with Express.js and MySQL.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- MySQL server running



The `createConnection` method in TypeORM has been deprecated in favor of `DataSource`. Here's how you can update the example to use `DataSource` instead.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Initialize Project**

```bash
mkdir typeorm-express-project
cd typeorm-express-project
npm init -y
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
npm install express typeorm mysql2 reflect-metadata
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/express ts-node
```

3. **Configure TypeScript**

Create a `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```

4. **Project Structure**

Create the following directory structure:

```
src/
│   app.ts
│   index.ts
└───entity/
    │   User.ts
```

5. **Database Configuration**

Create a `data-source.ts` file in the `src` directory:

```typescript
import { DataSource } from 'typeorm';
import { User } from './entity/User';

export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
  type: 'mysql',
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 3306,
  username: 'root',
  password: 'yourpassword',
  database: 'testdb',
  synchronize: true,
  logging: false,
  entities: [User],
  migrations: [],
  subscribers: [],
});
```

6. **Create Entity**

Create `src/entity/User.ts`:

```typescript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from 'typeorm';

@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  firstName: string;

  @Column()
  lastName: string;

  @Column()
  age: number;
}
```

7. **Setup Express App**

Create `src/app.ts`:

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';
import express from 'express';
import { AppDataSource } from './data-source';
import { User } from './entity/User';

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

AppDataSource.initialize()
  .then(() => {
    const userRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(User);

    app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
      const users = await userRepository.find();
      res.json(users);
    });

    app.post('/users', async (req, res) => {
      const user = userRepository.create(req.body);
      const result = await userRepository.save(user);
      res.send(result);
    });

    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('Server started on http://localhost:3000');
    });
  })
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

8. **Entry Point**

Create `src/index.ts`:

```typescript
import 'reflect-metadata';
import { AppDataSource } from './data-source';

AppDataSource.initialize()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Connected to the database');
  })
  .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

9. **Scripts**

Add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "ts-node src/app.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
  "serve": "node dist/app.js"
}
```

### Explanation of Each Part

1. **Project Initialization**: 
   - `npm init -y` initializes a new Node.js project with default settings.

2. **Dependencies Installation**:
   - `express`: Web framework for Node.js.
   - `typeorm`: ORM library for TypeScript and JavaScript.
   - `mysql2`: MySQL client for Node.js.
   - `reflect-metadata`: Metadata reflection API used by TypeORM.
   - `typescript`, `@types/express`, `ts-node`: TypeScript support and type definitions for Express.

3. **TypeScript Configuration**:
   - `tsconfig.json` sets up the TypeScript compiler options, enabling decorators and specifying output directories.

4. **Project Structure**:
   - Organized into directories for entities, migrations, and the main app logic.

5. **Database Configuration**:
   - `data-source.ts` sets up the `DataSource` instance with database connection settings.

6. **Entity Creation**:
   - `User.ts` defines a `User` entity with properties `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age`. The `@Entity` decorator marks the class as a database table, and other decorators define columns.

7. **Express App Setup**:
   - `app.ts` sets up the Express application, initializes the database connection using `DataSource`, and defines routes to handle user data.

8. **Entry Point**:
   - `index.ts` initializes the database connection when the application starts.

9. **Scripts**:
   - Scripts in `package.json` facilitate building, starting, and serving the application.

### Running the Application

1. **Start MySQL Server**: Ensure your MySQL server is running and accessible.
2. **Run the Application**: Use the following command to start your application:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see a message indicating that the server has started, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

- **GET `/users`**: Fetches all users.
- **POST `/users`**: Creates a new user. Send JSON data like `{"firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe", "age": 25}`.

This setup should resolve the decorator errors and get your TypeORM and Express.js project up and running with the new `DataSource` API.
