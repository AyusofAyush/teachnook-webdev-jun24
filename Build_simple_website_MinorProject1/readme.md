What is Flexbox?
In CSS, we use Flexbox, a layout model that offers us a variety of ways to arrange the element and helps us align the element in CSS. With Flexbox's help, we can design responsive and dynamic webpage or user interface layouts.


Flex-direction: with the help of flex-direction, we can arrange the element in any direction, like a row, a column, and a row reverse or a column reverse.
Justify-content: Determines how flex items are aligned horizontally within the container using the justify-content property.
Align-items: Defines the vertical alignment of flex items inside the container.
Flex-wrap: It specifies whether or not flex items should wrap across multiple lines or remain on a single line.
Align-content: When the cross-axis has extra space, align-content regulates how the flex lines are aligned.
.... etc.
